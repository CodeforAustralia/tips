# This is about me
I'm a digital product and user experience designer wanting to make positive change through human centred design.

## Background
I am a Digital Product & UX Designer. I work with agencies and businesses to design products that solve complex user problems. I am passionate about human centred design. My approach is tailored to the problem I'm solving and research is always at the centre. My strengths lie in user empathy and communicating this with teams I work with, creating a collaborative environment and constantly testing and questioning my designs. This results in products that solve real problems, are innovative, useful and user friendly.
