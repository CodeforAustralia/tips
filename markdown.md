# Markdown
A simplified document syntax. Markdown provides an easy to read and easy to write way to create a document. Markdown documents are written in plain text with tags and basic formatting instructions, it uses punctuation characters that closely resemble the intended output and the document can then be converted to various formats (.html, .word, .odt).

## Basic

`# This is a level 1 heading`
`## This is a level 2 heading`

`This is a block of markdown text, this text will generate a paragraph, the paragraph will end when i start a new blank line.`
